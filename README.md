NOTES: The search from BooksAPI is limited to a particular set of search terms.
You can find these search terms here:
https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md

However, remember that the BooksAPI.search method DOES search by title or author. So, don't worry if
you don't find a specific author or title. Every search is limited by search terms.
